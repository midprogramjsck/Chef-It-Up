## Overview
### Description
User will be able to obtain various cuisine recipes by selecting filters based on their preference at the given time.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Food
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer, such as other similar apps. Functionality wouldnâ€™t be limited to mobile devices, however mobile version could potentially have more features.
- **Story:** Selection of various cuisine recipes, along with the option of filtering the selections to narrow down searches.
- **Market:** Any individual can utilize this app, however it can be filtered to display certain foods.
- **Habit:** This app can be used anytime a user would like to cook a specific cuisine.
- **Scope:** First, we would like for the app to have a filtering option for different types of cuisine. Eventually, we would like for it to allow users to upload their own recipes and recieve feedback as well as give feedback to other recipes.
